                           <p slide__text>Answer: In comparison to other countries of the EU, the cost of living is
                              relatively low. Of course, the cost of living varies from city to city. For example, this
                              means that living in Paphos might be a bit cheaper than living in Limassol. </p>

                              take about 1-3 months. Of course, each situation is different and this timeframe may vary

                           <p slide__text>Answer: While a residency card can be obtained within two months through the

                              completing 5 years (1825 days) of legal stay in Cyprus, according to the naturalization
                              scheme based on years of residence (M127). Once acquired, permanent residency in Cyprus is
